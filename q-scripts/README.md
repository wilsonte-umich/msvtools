Folder 'msvtools/q-scripts' carries q master scripts 
for running msvtools analysis using the 
[q-pipeline-manager](https://github.com/wilsonte-umich/q-pipeline-manager).

The q utility assists with integrated pipeline execution and submission
to a job scheduler on a shared cluster server.

See the q documentation and q-scripts for details.

It is not necessary to use q to run msvtools.
